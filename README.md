# PROBLEM STATEMENT:-
In the transition of patients from high acuity environments such as operating
rooms (OR) or intensive care units (ICU) to lower acuity wards, significant
physiological changes may occur due to the altered environmental conditions.
Among these patients, individuals experiencing frequent seizure attacks and several critical health issues present in a particularly critical scenario,
often necessitating immediate medical attention. However, the timely arrival of ambulance services may pose
challenges, potentially exacerbating the patient's condition.
To address this challenge, our solution entails the utilization of 
monitoring devices capable of real-time data collection and analysis. By
leveraging advanced hardware and software components, we establish a
comprehensive monitoring system integrated with Internet of Things (IoT) and ML
cloud infrastructure, specifically utilizing the Blynk and ubidots platform.
This system enables continuous monitoring of the patient's physiological
parameters, including vital signs and seizure activity, during the transition
period from high to low acuity environments and beyond. By aggregating
and analyzing this real-time data, healthcare providers can remotely
assess the patient's condition and make informed decisions regarding the
necessity of hospital admission or discharge.
# OUR APPROACH :-
1.We will use various sensors like Pulse sensor,Temparature Sensor,Blood Pressure  Sensor etc. to collect  the data from the patient's body to monitor the physiological changes.
2.We will then send this data through ESP32 Microcontroller to process  and transmit the data.
3.We will then send this processsed data through Blink IOT and Ubidots platform to  the hospital dashboard that will update with patient’s condition.
4.We will use  Techniques of Machine Learning algorithm to collect data via ECG electrodes through patient’s body and monitor the changes .
5.We will use a AI assistant chatbot that will help to communicate with the dashboard continuously.

The implementation of this solution offers several key benifits
including:-
Timely intervention: Immediate detection of changing severe health condition of patients allows for prompt medical response, 
even in the absence of onsite healthcare professionals.
Cost savings: By avoiding unnecessary hospital admissions
for patients whose condition is stable, significant cost savings
can be achieved within the healthcare system.
Enhanced patient outcomes: Continuous monitoring
facilitates early detection of signs of recovery, enabling
timely discharge and improving overall patient outcomes.
In summary, our solution combines cutting-edge hardware,
software, and cloud-based infrastructure to address the critical need
for continuous monitoring of patients transitioning between high
and low acuity environments. By leveraging wearable technology
and IoT connectivity, we empower healthcare providers to deliver
timely and effective care, ultimately improving patient outcomes
and reducing healthcare costs.

# TECH STACK USED-
IOT,ARDUINO UNO,BLYNK SOFTWARE,AI/ML,WEB DEVELOPMENT
# BASIC OVERFLOW :- 
1. Assemble and test each sensor with the ESP32 individually.
2. Integrate all sensors with the ESP32, ensuring stable
simultaneous operation.
3. Implement signal processing algorithms to extract clean data
from the sensors.
4. Establish connectivity with the Blink IoT platform and ensure
reliable data transmission.
5. Develop or set up the hospital dashboard to receive and display
patient data.
Test the entire system for accuracy, reliability, and user
experience.
